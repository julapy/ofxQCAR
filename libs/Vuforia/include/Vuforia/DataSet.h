 *  provided by the ObjectTracker class. The dataset is then loaded given a
 *  dataset XML and corresponding dataset DAT file. The dataset may be loaded
 *  from the storage locations defined below. Note that the root filename of the
 *  dataset DAT file and XML file must be the same. Once loaded the dataset can
 *  be activated using ObjectTracker::activateDataSet().
 *  Methods to modify a DataSet must not be called while it is active. The
 *  DataSet must be deactivated first before reconfiguring it.
