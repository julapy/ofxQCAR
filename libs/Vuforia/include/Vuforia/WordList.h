/**
 *  The WordList represents the set of detectable Words. This list is
 *  loaded from a binary data file using loadWordList.
 *  By default a WordList for the English language is provided with the SDK.
 *  The application may choose to add a small set of additional custom words to
 *  the WordList using the APIs below.
 *  The filter list allows an application to specify a subset of Words
 *  from the WordList that will be detected and tracked. 
 *  Due to the large number of words in the WordList it is not possible to
 *  query the contents of the WordList at run-time.
 *  Note that the TextTracker needs to be stopped prior to making modifications
 *  to the WordList.
