# ofxQCAR

ofxQCAR is an OpenFrameworks wrapper for Qualcomm's Vuforia (QCAR) for vision-based augmented reality applications ([https://developer.vuforia.com](http://)).

ofxQCAR wraps Vuforia SDK 5.0.5 and works with OpenFrameworks 0.9.0 on iOS only.

The example project should get you up and running very quickly, although if you need to start your own XCode project from scratch, you will need to add the following frameworks to your XCode project.

*1) Security.framework*

*2) SystemConfiguration.framework*

*3) CoreMotion.framework*
