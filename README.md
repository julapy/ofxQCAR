# ofxQCAR

ofxQCAR is an OpenFrameworks wrapper for Qualcomm's Vuforia (QCAR) for vision-based augmented reality applications ([https://developer.vuforia.com](https://developer.vuforia.com)).

ofxQCAR wraps Vuforia SDK 5.5.9 and works with OpenFrameworks 0.9.0+ on iOS only.

The example projects should get you up and running very quickly.  To learn more about them, see their README.md.

To generate up-to-date project files, use the openFrameworks project generator.  The required system frameworks (`Security.framework`, `SystemConfiguration.framework`, and `CoreMotion.framework`) will be added by the project generator.
